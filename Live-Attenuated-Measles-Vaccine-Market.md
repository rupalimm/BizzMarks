The growth of the market is primarily driven by increased global awareness of measles prevention, rising vaccination initiatives, and government-supported immunization programs aimed at eradicating the disease worldwide. This vaccine is highly effective in preventing measles and is an essential part of the World Health Organizationâ€™s vaccination programs. Increasing efforts in developing countries, especially in the African and Asian regions, are expected to further accelerate market growth. As the vaccination coverage increases, the demand for the live attenuated measles vaccine is expected to rise significantly, thus contributing to the market expansion over the forecast period.</p><h2>Live Attenuated Measles Vaccine Market, By Application Segmentation</h2><p>The Live Attenuated Measles Vaccine is primarily applied in pediatric vaccination programs, as measles primarily affects children under the age of five. The demand for vaccines in this application is substantial due to widespread government vaccination campaigns and the growing need to prevent outbreaks in developing nations. In addition to routine childhood vaccination, this vaccine is also incorporated into the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, further broadening its usage. The pediatric segment is anticipated to hold a dominant share in the market, especially as vaccination coverage expands in low- and middle-income countries. Furthermore, with the rise in awareness campaigns targeting the importance of childhood immunizations, the uptake of measles vaccines is expected to continue to rise, making this a critical application segment in the market.</p><h2>Live Attenuated Measles Vaccine Market, By Application Segmentation</h2><p>In addition to pediatric applications, the live attenuated measles vaccine is also used in adult vaccination programs, especially for individuals at risk of exposure to measles, such as healthcare workers, travelers, and those in outbreak-prone areas. In many countries, the vaccine is recommended for adults who have not received the vaccine as children or who lack immunity. This has led to a rising demand in the adult vaccination segment. Furthermore, the increasing number of international travelers and migrant populations has spurred a need for widespread immunization campaigns targeting adults. Governments and health organizations are increasingly recognizing the importance of adult vaccination to prevent measles outbreaks, which is likely to drive market growth in this segment over the forecast period. Adult applications are expected to witness significant growth, especially in regions where measles cases remain a public health threat.</p></h3><h3 id="" class="">Who is the largest manufacturers of&nbsp;Live Attenuated Measles Vaccine Market worldwide?</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>GSK</Li><Li> Sanofi-Pasteur</Li><Li> Merck</Li><Li> Pfizer</Li><Li> Serum Institute of India</Li><Li> Novartis</Li><Li> Emergent Biosolutions</Li><Li> Bavarian Nordic</Li><Li> Medimmune</Li><Li> Johnson & Johnson</Li><Li> CSL Limited</Li><Li> Changchun Qijian Biological Products Co.</Li><Li> Ltd</Li><Li> Beijing Institute of Biological Products Co.</Li><Li> Ltd</Li><Li> Wuhan Institute of Biological Products Co.</Li><Li> Ltd</Li><Li> Shanghai Institute of Biological Products Co.</Li><Li> Ltd</Li><Li> Lanzhou Institute of Biological Products Co.</Li><Li> Ltd</h3><h3 id="ember53" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">Global&nbsp;Live Attenuated Measles Vaccine Market Segmentation:</h3><p id="ember54" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Segmentation analysis involves dividing the market into distinct groups based on certain criteria, such as type and application.
